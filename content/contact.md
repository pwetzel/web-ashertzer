This stuff could be on the home page instead of on its own separate page if you
prefer. There are two versions available, a side box and a bottom box. Both are
on this page, which you would not do normally of course. The theme supports a
pile of possible services, which you can see [here](https://github.com/gevhaz/hugo-theme-notrack/blob/master/data/notrack/social.yaml).

I know you don't have twitter, but I think you mentioned it as something you
were thinking of getting into.
