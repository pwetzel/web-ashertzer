[Curriculum Vitae](ShertzerAllison_CV.pdf)

I am an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh,
where I am also affiliated with Urban Studies. I am a Research Associate at
the National Bureau of Economics in the Development of the American Economy
Program. My research focuses on the economic history of cities in the
United States. Much of my work centers on the origins of residential
segregation by race in northern American urban areas. I am also interested
in early land use regulation as well as the impact of immigration on the
provision of public goods. My current research is focused on housing and
land prices in urban areas since the Civil War.
